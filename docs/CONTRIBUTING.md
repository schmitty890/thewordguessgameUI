# Contributing to The Word Guess Game

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

Reporting a bug
Discussing the current state of the code
Submitting a fix
Proposing new features
Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed/added APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!


## Branching process (for maintainers)

- Master and Develop branches are ðŸ”’protected branchesðŸ”’. This means we need at least 1 approval before we merge into our master or develop branch. (having these branches protected helps so we know for sure what is going into master and develop, and noone can accidentally push code to it and break our project)
- Develop will be the branch we create branches off of. Develop will be merged into master at the end of every day.
- This screenshot ðŸ‘‡ illustrates this process
- Feature A and Feature B are branches where we code our tasks. Once finished with making your edits, we merge that branch into develop. At the end of everyday, develop gets merged into master.
- Then develop is updated with the latest version of master, and the process happens all over again.
